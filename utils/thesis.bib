	abstract = {Anisotropic electron-phonon interaction is shown to lead to the anisotropic polaron effect. The resulting anisotropy of the polaron band is an exponential function of the electron-phonon coupling and might be as large as 103. This also makes anisotropy very sensitive to small changes of coupling and implies wide variations of anisotropy among compounds of similar structure. The isotope effect on mass anisotropy is predicted. Polaron masses are obtained by an exact quantum Monte Carlo method. Implications for high-temperature superconductors are briefly discussed.},

It leads to a perturbation series that can be summed exactly by the diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo technique. The ground-state energy, effective mass, spectrum, and density of states of the three-dimensional JTP are calculated with no systematic errors. The band structure of JTP is found to be similar to that of the Holstein polaron. The mass of JTP increases exponentially with the coupling constant. At small phonon frequencies, the spectrum of JTP is flat at large momenta, which leads to a strongly distorted density of states with a massive peak at the top of the band.},

	abstract = {Machine-learned force fields have transformed the atomistic modelling of materials by enabling simulations of ab initio quality on unprecedented time and length scales. However, they are currently limited by: (i) the significant computational and human effort that must go into development and validation of potentials for each particular system of interest; and (ii) a general lack of transferability from one chemical system to the next. Here, using the state-of-the-art MACE architecture we introduce a single general-purpose ML model, trained on a public database of 150k inorganic crystals, that is capable of running stable molecular dynamics on molecules and materials. We demonstrate the power of the MACE-MP-0 model - and its qualitative and at times quantitative accuracy - on a diverse set problems in the physical sciences, including the properties of solids, liquids, gases, chemical reactions, interfaces and even the dynamics of a small protein. The model can be applied out of the box and as a starting or "foundation model" for any atomistic system of interest and is thus a step towards democratising the revolution of ML force fields by lowering the barriers to entry.},

Herein we report first-principles lattice dynamics (phonon spectrum) for each phase of CH3NH3PbI3. The equilibrium structures compare well to solutions of temperature-dependent powder neutron diffraction. By following the normal modes, we calculate infrared and Raman intensities of the vibrations, and compare them to the measurement of a single crystal where the Raman laser is controlled to avoid degradation of the sample. Despite a clear separation in energy between low-frequency modes associated with the inorganic (PbI3−)n network and high-frequency modes of the organic CH3NH3+ cation, significant coupling between them is found, which emphasizes the interplay between molecular orientation and the corner-sharing octahedral networks in the structural transformations. Soft modes are found at the boundary of the Brillouin zone of the cubic phase, consistent with displacive instabilities and anharmonicity involving tilting of the PbI6 octahedra around room temperature.},

	abstract = {The chapter presents a discussion on the theory of polaron mobility. The Boltzmann equation adapted to the Feynman picture of the polaron is reviewed. The first moment of this equation, which expresses conservation of momentum in the case of slowly varying fields, is calculated. The chapter also discusses the properties of the Feynman polaron model Hamiltonian. The linear ac conductivity is studied in the classical frequency region by solving the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA). From this polaron distribution function, the impedance function is calculated, which in the limit of zero frequency equals the polaron impedance result of Osaka. The chapter also presents a discussion from the first moment of the Boltzmann equation, which is a scalar equation. If one chooses for the polaron distribution function a drifted Maxwellian, the Thornber–Feynman (TF) result is obtained, for the nonlinear dc conductivity. The corresponding electron distribution function is calculated. It is a drifted Maxwellian with an effective electron temperature, which is only a function of the lattice temperature and the parameters of the Feynman polaron model (these parameters are a measure of the effective electron-phonon interaction). The validity of the TF result is discussed. The linear ac conductivity at quantum frequencies is studied. The Feynman–Hellwarth–Iddings–Platzman (FHIP) result for the impedance function is obtained. The polaron mass and mobility are calculated in various approximations.},

To illustrate the general strategy, the method is applied to an analytically solvable, non-trivial, model: the one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse field. Next it is shown how to generalized Trotter formula most naturally leads to different path-integral representations of the partition function by considering one-dimensional fermion lattice models. We show how to analyze the different representations and discuss Monte Carlo simulation results for one-dimensional fermions. Then Monte Carlo work on one- and two-dimensional spin-12 models based upon the Trotter formula approach is reviewed and the more dedicated Handscomb Monte Carlo method is discussed. We consider electron-phonon models and discuss Monte Carlo simulation data on the Molecular Crystal Model in one, two and three dimensions and related one-dimensional polaron models. Exact numerical results are presented for free fermions and free bosons in the canonical ensemble. We address the main problem of Monte Carlo simulations of fermions in more than one dimension: the cancellation of large contributions.

The rate of loss of momentum by an electron drifting through the crystal in the applied fields is expressed in a form in which the lattice coordinates (the phonons) have been eliminated exactly by path-integral methods. The quadratic influence functional used to simulate the electron-lattice interaction is shown to be derivable from a self-consistent relation for the impedance tensor of the electron in its drifting frame of reference. This eliminates the ambiguity of which influence functional to use in path-integral treatments of electron transport. For zero applied electric and magnetic fields, it is shown that the self-consistency is equivalent to minimizing the free energy of the electron-phonon system at finite temperatures. The Feynman one-oscillator model is discussed in the light of the self-consistency relation. Several important changes are indicated by an approximate self-consistent solution for low temperature. The applied magnetic and electric field problem is briefly discussed. For optical-phonon scattering, it is shown that the cyclotron mass is the same as the dynamic effective mass in the absence of a magnetic field. For the Fröhlich polaron model, it is shown that, because of the influence of the magnetic field on the scattering rate, a longitudinal magnetoresistivity should exist equal to exactly one-half of the transverse value. Finally, two limitations of this general approach are noted and discussed briefly.},

We present numerical calculations of field (loss of energy per unit distance) versus velocity for three coupling strengths using the Fröhlich polaron model. In a single curve, all the expected phenomena appear, including a threshold field for producing hot electrons and a decreasing rate of energy loss with velocity for very fast electrons. Using only the experimentally measured values of the reststrahlen energy and the static and optical dielectric constants, we find an energy loss of 0.025 eV/Å for electrons near the threshold in Al2O3, which compares favorably with the experimental value of about 0.03 eV/Å. We conclude that optical-phonon scattering can indeed produce the high rate of energy loss that is present in tunnel-cathode structures.},

	abstract = {A formalism has been developed, using Feynman's space-time formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics whereby the behavior of a system of interest, which is coupled to other external quantum systems, may be calculated in terms of its own variables only. It is shown that the effect of the external systems in such a formalism can always be included in a general class of functionals (influence functionals) of the coordinates of the system only. The properties of influence functionals for general systems are examined. Then, specific forms of influence functionals representing the effect of definite and random classical forces, linear dissipative systems at finite temperatures, and combinations of these are analyzed in detail. The linear system analysis is first done for perfectly linear systems composed of combinations of harmonic oscillators, loss being introduced by continuous distributions of oscillators. Then approximately linear systems and restrictions necessary for the linear behavior are considered. Influence functionals for all linear systems are shown to have the same form in terms of their classical response functions. In addition, a fluctuation-dissipation theorem is derived relating temperature and dissipation of the linear system to a fluctuating classical potential acting on the system of interest which reduces to the Nyquist-Johnson relation for noise in the case of electric circuits. Sample calculations of transition probabilities for the spontaneous emission of an atom in free space and in a cavity are made. Finally, a theorem is proved showing that within the requirements of linearity all sources of noise or quantum fluctuation introduced by maser-type amplification devices are accounted for by a classical calculation of the characteristics of the maser.},

Such polarons are often described using the Fröhlich Hamiltonian, which assumes the underlying lattice phonons to be harmonic. However, this approximation is invalid in several interesting materials, including the recently discovered high-pressure hydrides which superconduct at temperatures above 200 K. In this paper, we show that Fröhlich theory can be extended to eliminate this problem. We derive four additional terms in the Fröhlich Hamiltonian to account for anharmonicity up to third order. We calculate the energy and effective mass of the new polaron, using both perturbation theory and Feynman's path-integral formalism. It is shown that the anharmonic terms lead to significant additional trapping of the electron. The derived Hamiltonian is well suited for analytical calculations, due to its simplicity and since the number of model parameters is low. Since it is a direct extension of the Fröhlich Hamiltonian, it can readily be used to investigate the effect of anharmonicity on other polaron properties, such as the optical conductivity and the formation of bipolarons.},

The impedance function of the quadratic model serves as the variational parameter. It is shown that a very small change in the energy can be accompanied by a large change in the optical conductivity. This is related to the insensitivity of the Jensen-Feynman free energy to the UV properties of the model.

	abstract = {Lead halide perovskite semiconductors are soft, polar materials. The strong driving force for polaron formation (the dielectric electron-phonon coupling) is balanced by the light band effective masses, leading to a strongly-interacting large polaron. A first-principles prediction of mobility would help understand the fundamental mobility limits. Theories of mobility need to consider the polaron (rather than free-carrier) state due to the strong interactions. In this material we expect that at room temperature polar-optical phonon mode scattering will dominate and so limit mobility. We calculate the temperature-dependent polaron mobility of hybrid halide perovskites by variationally solving the Feynman polaron model with the finite-temperature free energies of Ōsaka. This model considers a simplified effective-mass band structure interacting with a continuum dielectric of characteristic response frequency. We parametrize the model fully from electronic-structure calculations. In methylammonium lead iodide at 300K we predict electron and hole mobilities of 133 and 94cm2V−1s−1, respectively. These are in acceptable agreement with single-crystal measurements, suggesting that the intrinsic limit of the polaron charge carrier state has been reached. Repercussions for hot-electron photoexcited states are discussed. As well as mobility, the model also exposes the dynamic structure of the polaron. This can be used to interpret impedance measurements of the charge-carrier state. We provide the phonon-drag mass renormalization and scattering time constants. These could be used as parameters for larger-scale device models and band-structure dependent mobility simulations.},

	abstract = {The two-dimensional molecular crystal model of Friedman and Holstein describing the motion of a small polaron in the presence of a magnetic field is studied in the adiabatic approximation. Upon averaging over the electronic coordinates, according to the standard prescription, one finds that the vibrational Hamiltonian contains (in addition to the usual terms, namely the carrier-free vibrational Hamiltonian supplemented by the energy of the excess electron expressed as a function of vibrational coordinates) a term which is linearly dependent on the lattice momentum and proportional to the magnetic field. In the adiabatic theory the effect of the magnetic field on the motion of the small polaron is found by studying the influence of the magnetic term of the vibrational Hamiltonian on the particular vibrational motions which correspond to the passage of the excess carrier from one site to a particular neighbor. In the present work, concerned only with the high temperature regime (in practice, temperatures above 12θDebye) within which the small polaron moves through the lattice by a succession of incoherent jumps between neighboring sites, the vibrational motion is treated classically, as is appropriate at sufficiently high temperatures. It is found that although the temperature dependence of the drift mobility that is herein calculated differs little from that derived in the Friedman-Holstein perturbation calculation, the Hall mobility temperature dependence (for reasonable choices of the physical parameters) differs markedly from the perturbation result. In particular, for appropriate choices of the physical parameters, the adiabatic Hall mobility can be a decreasing function of temperature. Thus the absence of an activated Hall mobility is not in itself evidence against small polaron motion.},

While the electron-phonon interaction has been studied for almost a century, predictive nonempirical calculations have become feasible only during the past two decades. Today it is possible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related to the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the temperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron mass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the nonadiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations. In this article a review of the theoretical and computational framework underlying modern electron-phonon calculations from first principles as well as landmark investigations of the electron-phonon interaction in real materials is given. The first part of the article summarizes the elementary theory of electron-phonon interactions and their calculations based on density-functional theory. The second part discusses a general field-theoretic formulation of the electron-phonon problem and establishes the connection with practical first-principles calculations. The third part reviews a number of recent investigations of electron-phonon interactions in the areas of vibrational spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, optical spectroscopy, transport, and superconductivity.},

	abstract = {A set of successively more accurate self-consistent equations for the one-electron Green's function have been derived. They correspond to an expansion in a screened potential rather than the bare Coulomb potential. The first equation is adequate for many purposes. Each equation follows from the demand that a corresponding expression for the total energy be stationary with respect to variations in the Green's function. The main information to be obtained, besides the total energy, is one-particle-like excitation spectra, i.e., spectra characterized by the quantum numbers of a single particle. This includes the low-excitation spectra in metals as well as configurations in atoms, molecules, and solids with one electron outside or one electron missing from a closed-shell structure. In the latter cases we obtain an approximate description by a modified Hartree-Fock equation involving a "Coulomb hole" and a static screened potential in the exchange term. As an example, spectra of some atoms are discussed. To investigate the convergence of successive approximations for the Green's function, extensive calculations have been made for the electron gas at a range of metallic densities. The results are expressed in terms of quasiparticle energies E(k) and quasiparticle interactions f(k, k′). The very first approximation gives a good value for the magnitude of E(k). To estimate the derivative of E(k) we need both the first- and the second-order terms. The derivative, and thus the specific heat, is found to differ from the free-particle value by only a few percent. Our correction to the specific heat keeps the same sign down to the lowest alkali-metal densities, and is smaller than those obtained recently by Silverstein and by Rice. Our results for the paramagnetic susceptibility are unreliable in the alkali-metal-density region owing to poor convergence of the expansion for f. Besides the proof of a modified Luttinger-Ward-Klein variational principle and a related self-consistency idea, there is not much new in principle in this paper. The emphasis is on the development of a numerically manageable approximation scheme.},

	abstract = {We present a highly efficient yet accurate analytical approximation for the Green’s function of a Holstein polaron. It is obtained by summing all the self-energy diagrams, but with each self-energy diagram averaged over the momenta of its free propagators. The result becomes exact for both zero bandwidth and for zero electron-phonon coupling and is accurate everywhere in the parameter space. The resulting Green’s function satisfies exactly the first six spectral weight sum rules. All higher sum rules are satisfied with great accuracy, becoming asymptotically exact for coupling both much larger and much smaller than the free particle bandwidth. Comparison with existing numerical data also confirms this accuracy. We use this approximation to analyze in detail the redistribution of the spectral weight as the coupling strength varies.},

Polaron ground state energies and effective polaron masses are successfully benchmarked with data obtained using Feynman's path integral formalism. By comparing 3D and 2D data, we verify the analytically exact scaling relations for energies and effective masses from 3D→2D, which provides a stringent test for the quality of DMC predictions. The accuracy of our results is further proven by providing values for the exactly known coefficients in weak- and strong-coupling expansions. Moreover, we compute polaron dispersion curves which are validated with analytically known lower and upper limits in the small-coupling regime and verify the first-order expansion results for larger couplings, thus disproving previous critiques on the apparent incompatibility of DMC with analytical results and furnishing useful reference for a wide range of coupling strengths.},

	abstract = {The one-dimensional molecular-crystal model of polaron motion, described in the preceding paper, is here analyzed for the case in which the electronic-overlap term of the total Hamiltonian is a small perturbation. In zeroth order —i.e., in the absence of this term—the electron is localized at a given site, p. The vibrational state of the system is specified by a set of quantum-numbers, Nk, giving the degree of excitation of each vibration-mode; the latter differ from the conventional modes in that in each of them, the equilibrium displacement, about which the system oscillates, depends upon the location of the electron. The presence of a nonvanishing electronic-overlap term gives rise to transitions in which the electron jumps to a neighboring site (p → p ± 1), and in which either all of the Nk remain unaltered (“diagonal” transitions) or in which some of them change by ±1 (“nondiagonal” transitions). The two types of transitions play fundamentally different roles. At sufficiently low temperatures, the diagonal transitions are dominant. They give rise to the formation of Bloch-type bands whose widths (see Eq. 37) are each given by the product of the electronic-overlap integral, and a vibrational overlap-integral, the latter being an exponentially falling function of the Nk (and, hence, of temperature). In this low-temperature domain, the role of the nondiagonal transitions is essentially one of scattering. In the absence of other scattering mechanisms, such as impurity scattering, they determine the lifetimes of the polaron-band states and, hence, the mean free path for typical transport quantities, such as electron diffusivity. With rising temperature, the probability of the off-diagonal transitions goes up exponentially. This feature, together with the above-mentioned drop in bandwidth, results, e.g., in an exponentially diminishing diffusivity. Eventually, a temperature, Tt ∼ 12 the Debye θ, is reached at which the energy uncertainty, h̷gt, associated with the finite lifetime of the states, is equal to the bandwidth. At this point, the Bloch states lose their individual characteristics (in particular, those which depend upon electronic wave number); the bands may then be considered as “washed out”. For temperatures {\textgreater}Tt, electron motion is predominantly a diffusion process. The elementary steps of this process consist of the random-jumps between neighboring sites associated with the nondiagonal transitions. In conformance with this picture, the electron diffusivity is, apart from a numerical factor, the product of the square of the lattice distance and the total non-diagonal transition probability, and is therefore an exponentially rising function of temperature. The limit, Jmax, of the magnitude of the electronic overlap term, beyond which the perturbation treatment of the present paper becomes inapplicable, is investigated. For representative values of the parameters entering into the theory, Jmax ∼ 0.12 ev and 0.035 ev for the extreme cases of (a) width of the ground-state polaron-band and (b) high-temperature site-jump probabilities (these numbers correspond to electronic bandwidths of 0.24 ev and 0.07 ev, respectively). For electronic bandwidths in excess of these limits, a treatment based on the adiabatic approach is required; preliminary results of such a treatment are given for the above two cases.},

	abstract = {In this paper is described a model for polaron motion which incorporates, in simplified form, the principal physical features of the problem. The (crystalline) medium, within which a single excess electron (or hole) is contained, is taken to be a one-dimensional molecular crystal, consisting of diatomic molecular sites; each site possesses a single vibrational degree of freedom, represented by the deviation, xn, of its internuclear separation from equilibrium. The motion of the electron in this medium is treated by a tight-binding approach, in which the wave function is represented as a superposition of local “molecular” functions, φ(r − na, xn). In line with the xn dependence of the δ's, it is also assumed that the “local” electronic energy, En, (which, in the conventional tight-binding theory, has one and the same value for all sites) depends (linearly) on xn. This dependence gives rise to electron-lattice interaction; alternatively, it may be regarded as removing the electronic translational degeneracy, characteristic of the undistorted crystal, and thereby providing the possibility for electron trapping. On the basis of the above-described model, the zeroth order adiabatic treatment of the polaron problem is developed. For values of the parameters such that the linear dimension of the polaron is large compared to a lattice spacing (“large” polaron), an exact solution is obtained; the correspondence between it and Pekar's zeroth-order solution is established. The conditions under which the size of the polaron becomes comparable to a lattice spacing (“small” polaron) are discussed. Finally, by way of exhibiting the relationship of the molecular-crystal concept to the real situation, a description is given of an alternate molecular-crystal model which, in the case of the large polaron, is completely equivalent to the continuum-polarization model of conventional polaron theory.},

	abstract = {Polarons, that is, charge carriers correlated with lattice deformations, are ubiquitous quasiparticles in semiconductors, and play an important role in electrical conductivity. To date most theoretical studies of so-called large polarons, in which the lattice can be considered as a continuum, have focused on the original Fröhlich model: a simple (nondegenerate) parabolic isotropic electronic band coupled to one dispersionless longitudinal optical phonon branch. The Fröhlich model allows one to understand characteristics such as polaron formation energy, radius, effective mass, and mobility. Real cubic materials, instead, have electronic band extrema that are often degenerate (e.g., threefold degeneracy of the valence band), or anisotropic (e.g., conduction bands at X or L), and present several phonon modes. In the present paper, we address such issues. We keep the continuum hypothesis inherent to the large polaron Fröhlich model, but waive the isotropic and nondegeneracy hypotheses, and also include multiple phonon branches. For polaron effective masses, working at the lowest order of perturbation theory, we provide analytical results for the case of anisotropic electronic energy dispersion, with two distinct effective masses (uniaxial) and numerical simulations for the degenerate three-band case, typical of III-V and II-VI semiconductor valence bands. We also deal with the strong-coupling limit, using a variational treatment: we propose trial wave functions for the above-mentioned cases, providing polaron radii and energies. Then, we evaluate the polaron formation energies, effective masses, and localization lengths using parameters representative of a dozen II-VI, III-V, and oxide semiconductors, for both electron and hole polarons. We show that for some cases perturbation theory (the weak-coupling approach) breaks down. In some other cases, the strong-coupling approach reveals that the large polaron hypothesis is not valid, which is another distinct breakdown. In the nondegenerate case, we compare the perturbative approach with the Feynman path integral approach in characterizing polarons in the weak-coupling limit. Thus, based on theoretical results for cubic materials, the present paper characterizes the validity of the continuum hypothesis for a large set of 20 materials.},

While the carrier population dynamics during cooling have been scrutinized, the evolution of the hot carrier properties, namely mobility, remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce novel ultrafast visible pump–infrared push–terahertz probe spectroscopy to monitor the real-time conductivity dynamics of cooling carriers in methylammonium lead iodide. We find a decrease in mobility upon optically re-exciting the carriers, as expected for band transport. Surprisingly, the conductivity recovery is incommensurate with the hot carrier population dynamics measured by infrared probe and exhibits a negligible dependence on the hot carrier density. Our results reveal the importance of localized lattice heating toward the hot carrier mobility. This collective polaron-lattice phenomenon may contribute to the unusual photophysics of MHPs and should be accounted for in hot carrier devices.},

Transport in this regime cannot be described by the kinetic equation. We employ the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method to study the mobility of a Fröhlich polaron in this regime and discover a number of nonperturbative effects: a strong violation of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel criterion at intermediate and strong couplings, a mobility minimum at T∼Ω in the strong-coupling limit (Ω is the optical mode frequency), a substantial delay in the onset of an exponential dependence of the mobility for T{\textless}Ω at intermediate coupling, and complete smearing of the Drude peak at strong coupling. These effects should be taken into account when interpreting mobility data in materials with strong electron-phonon coupling.},

	abstract = {The optical absorption of polarons at rest at zero temperature is calculated starting from the Feynman-Hellwarth-Iddings-Platzman (FHIP) theory of the impedance. The results are compared with the results of theories whose physical interpretation is clearer [weak-coupling theory of Gurevich, Lang, and Firsov (GLF) and product-ansatz strong-coupling theory of Kartheuser, Evrard, and Devreese (KED)] in order to obtain a better understanding of the FHIP approximation. We are particularly interested in the possible role of lattice relaxation [leading to relaxed excited states (RES)] in the optical absorption process. If the FHIP perturbation method were used to expand the conductivity (this would be the normal procedure), essentially Franck-Condon transitions would be found in the spectrum, and lattice relaxation would be absent. In this case the results do not fit with the product ansatz and provide merely the asymptotic limit α→0, where α is the electron-phonon coupling constant. If, however, the impedance function rather than the conductivity is expanded (as preferred by FHIP for intuitive reasons, without further justification) more reliable results for the optical absorption appear. For α{\textgreater}5, intense absorption peaks now occur, which presumably correspond to transitions to RES, and the results are in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the product-ansatz treatment in this coupling region. Also in the limit α→0 the correct behavior is found. For 3≲α≲5, the interpretation of the results is somewhat delicate but the possibility that RES contribute to the oscillator strength as soon as α{\textgreater}3 should be considered. The results so obtained for the optical absorption seem reliable at all α. This provides an indirect justification for the expansion of Z(Ω) rather than 1Z(Ω) in FHIP theory and a confirmation of the qualitative strong-coupling predictions of KED. The present study indicates that optical absorption peaks due to free polarons should be observable experimentally in crystals for which α{\textgreater}1.},

	abstract = {We have obtained an approximate expression for the impedance function at all frequencies, temperatures, and coupling strengths of an electron coupled to a polar lattice (a system commonly called a polaron). The starting point for the calculation is the quantum mechanical expression for the expected current. The phonon coordinates are eliminated from this expression by well-known field-theory techniques. The resulting exact "influence functional" is then approximated by a corresponding quadratic "influence functional" which, it is hoped, imitates the real polaron. Correction terms are computed to account for the difference between the approximate impedance and the exact polaron impedance in a manner closely analogous to Feynman's treatment of the polaron self-energy. In fact, the analytic evaluation of the expression for the impedance obtained here is carried out using the approximate "influence functional" that was successfully employed in minimizing the binding (and free) energy of the polaron in earlier calculations. However, the accuracy obtained using this approximation, for the impedance calculation, is less satisfactory and its limitations are discussed. Nevertheless, beginning at intermediate coupling strengths, the approximate impedance produces a level structure of increasing complexity and narrowing resonances as the coupling strengthens. This suggests that further refinements may be fruitful. Methods for finding a better quadratic influence functional for use in our impedance expression as well as ways of improving the expression further are suggested. A comparison of our results with those of the Boltzmann equation points up interesting differences which arise from reversing the order of taking limits of zero frequency and coupling.},

We show that the FHIP mobility theory predicts non-Drude transport behavior, and shows remarkably good agreement with the recent diagrammatic Monte Carlo mobility simulations of Mishchenko et al.

This enables a slightly better variational solution, as inferred from the resulting energy. We carry forward this extra complexity into the mobility theory, which shows a richer structure in the frequency and temperature-dependent mobility, due to the different phonon modes activating at different energies. The method provides a computationally efficient and fully quantitative method of predicting polaron mobility and response in real materials.},
