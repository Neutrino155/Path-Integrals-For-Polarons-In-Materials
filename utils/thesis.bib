	abstract = {The validity of the rules given in previous papers for the solution of problems in quantum electrodynamics is established. Starting with Fermi's formulation of the field as a set of harmonic oscillators, the effect of the oscillators is integrated out in the Lagrangian form of quantum mechanics. There results an expression for the effect of all virtual photons valid to all orders in e2ℏc. It is shown that evaluation of this expression as a power series in e2ℏc gives just the terms expected by the aforementioned rules.},

	abstract = {The Feynman path-integral variational approach to the polaron problem, along with the associated Feynman-Hellwarth-Iddings-Platzman (FHIP) linear-response mobility theory, provides a computationally amenable method to predict the frequency-resolved temperature-dependent charge-carrier mobility, and other experimental observables in polar semiconductors. We show that the FHIP mobility theory predicts non-Drude transport behavior, and shows remarkably good agreement with the recent diagrammatic Monte Carlo mobility simulations of Mishchenko et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 076601 (2019)] for the abstract Fröhlich Hamiltonian. We extend this method to multiple phonon modes in the Fröhlich model action. This enables a slightly better variational solution, as inferred from the resulting energy. We carry forward this extra complexity into the mobility theory, which shows a richer structure in the frequency and temperature-dependent mobility, due to the different phonon modes activating at different energies. The method provides a computationally efficient and fully quantitative method of predicting polaron mobility and response in real materials.},

	abstract = {The Fröhlich polaron model has been applied so far only to the case of electron states with simple parabolic bands. An extension is given of the polaron concept to more complex states as e.g. the valence bands in zincblende-type crystals. The band structure is described as in the spherical model of Baldereschi and Lipari. The electron-phonon interaction in the Fröhlich approximation is treated by perturbation theory. Besides a renormalization of the band parameters the electron-phonon coupling results in a partial mixing of electronic states from different subbands, i.e. of light and heavy holes.},

Sampling schemes for the Green function as well as the self-energy in the bare and skeleton (bold) expansion are disclosed in full detail. We discuss the Monte Carlo updates, possible implementations in terms of common data structures, as well as techniques on how to perform the Fourier transforms for functions with discontinuities. Control over the variety of parameters, especially in the bold scheme, is demonstrated. Sample codes are made available online along with extensive documentation. Towards the end, we discuss various extensions of the method and their applications. After working through these notes, the reader will be well equipped to explore the richness of the diagrammatic Monte Carlo method for quantum many-body systems.},
