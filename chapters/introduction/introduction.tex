\lettrine{S}emiconductor materials have enormous technical application in ranging from photovoltaic cells and light-emitting diodes to field-effect transistors and solid-state lasers. A key phenomenological quantity that influences the performance of a semiconductor is the charge carrier mobility. The required mobility depends on the application; for example, a solid-state laser require higher mobility than a photovoltaic cell. As a phenomenological quantity, mobility is not a direct ground state property. Instead, mobility arises from competitive dynamic processes within a material and can on occasion be strongly temperature-dependent. Most mobility theories tend to use semi-classical approximations for modelling the mobility; using an effective scattering time such as in Drude like models, or neglecting electron-phonon interactions as in the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Otherwise, it is usually assumed that the electron-phonon coupling is either weak or strong, where approximate limits are taken. However, some semiconductors, such as halide perovskites, possess large dielectric electron-phonon interactions, leading to the formation of large polarons. These materials typically exhibit intermediate electron-phonon coupling strengths. Alternatively, one can use the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics to derive an inherently quantum theory of mobility (\cite{feynman_slow_1955, feynman_mobility_1962}). Though based on a linear-response theory, this is non-perturbative and can provide a temperature-dependent model of mobility to all orders in the electron-phonon coupling strength.
